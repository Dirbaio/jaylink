TODO: Briefly describe the crate here (eg. "This crate provides ...").

Please refer to the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) to see what changed in the last
releases.

## Usage

Add an entry to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
jaylink = "0.0.0"
```

Check the [API Documentation](https://docs.rs/jaylink/) for how to use the
crate's functionality.

## Rust version support

This crate supports the 3 latest stable Rust releases. Bumping the minimum
supported Rust version (MSRV) is not considered a breaking change as long as
these 3 versions are still supported.

The MSRV is also explicitly tested against in [.travis.yml](.travis.yml).
